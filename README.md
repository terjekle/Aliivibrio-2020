# Aliivibrio identity
A repository for scripts used in the study of genus Aliivibrio.

Currently hosting the identity.py which evaluate the blunt identity between pairs of fasta sequences in a single file. The script is specifically meant for removal of gaps in a pair-wise manner. Thus, it avoids the greedyness and loss of valuable sequence data of complete deletion and the error of treating gaps as non-identical in an alignment.
